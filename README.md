# An ongoing experiment for more impactful data teams and for accelerated growth in companies

This project is inspired by this video https://youtu.be/Dbr8jmtfZ7Q?si=2qFXA_I7LmPYKiOL

## Problem Statement
- Explosion of data leaving companies to ask more and more questions to make decisions
- To answer these questions, data teams scramble to make dashboards to track various metrics
- Leading to thousands of dashboards, hundreds of metrics with no real connection to the business model
- Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio, stakeholders get more confused and then ask more question which in-turns leads to more dashboards and so on... a vicious cycle 

## Solution
- A derived "formaula" of the business using only metrics with correlation to each other and the key business metrics
- Run frequent experiments to strengthen correlations, add or discard metrics
- A web application to view this tree and accompanying dashboards for shared business understanding and for identification of growth levers.
